# SC1015: DSAI Mini Project - Multiple Disease Detection


### Description:
This repository contains all Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files, datasets, videos and source materials/references used (if any) that has been created/used as part of SC1015 DSAI Mini Project.

This README will highlight the main pointers and actions taken in the project. For more details, refer to the .ipynb files in this repo.

### 1. Problem Formulation:
Dataset Chosen: [Mutliple Disease Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehababoelnaga/multiple-disease-prediction)

**Problem Statement:** How might we detect various types diseases using blood work results?


As blood work is one of the most common test done in the medical field. Could we develop a predictive model that can identify the likelihood of various diseases based on the provided blook work results provided by the lab?

A sucuessful high confience model may be able to significantly impact patient care by allowing precise and early diagnostics, improving treatment outcomes and optimising resource allocation.

In the likely chance that the model may not have an high confidence in predicting the diseases. It could serve as a flag of sorts; placing more emphasis on certain few patients that may encounter such.

### 2. Data Preparation
As the dataset chosen was already pre-cleaned and managed well. There was little to no preparation and cleaning needed to analyse our data better.
